# JS_Project

Summary of Project:
    -Graphical representation of diabetes per state
    -Grouped by age? 
    -Interactive human body with diabetetic side effects
    -Pathophysiology of Diabetes


The Goal of my Project is to display the Mortality Rate and Number of Deaths caused by Diabetes Melitus over the past ten years. I plan to use a map and hover functionalities to highlight each selected state. I also want click functionality in order to select a state, and have a graph of the numbers of deaths per state grouped by statistics. Statistical grouping consists of state, age, gender, etc..

I want to be able to 
    -Illustrate a map of the 50 states and set background color according to mortality rate 
    -Hover over a state and have a text box appear with mortality rate
    -Illustrate a (bar?) graph illustrating the average statistics of 50 states
    -Click button to go back and forth between “entire us” and “state”
    -Click on a state and have the graph mutate to the statistics of that specific state
    -Fun facts regarding diabetes (type 1, type 2), links to medical articles, links to health tips.
    -Link to GitHub, LinkedIn.
